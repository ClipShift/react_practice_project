It can also assess the correct algorithm to be used in a future study. These paper talk about the different methods and proposed systems in which waste segregation took place. These also talk about the drawbacks faced by the already existing systems and algorithms they used. With it, this paper gives a lot of opportunities to produce new knowledge in creating a new system.";
